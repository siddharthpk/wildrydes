# Wildrydes

## What is it?

A simple web application that enables users to request unicorn rides from the Wild Rydes fleet. The application will present users with an HTML based user interface for indicating the location where they would like to be picked up and will interface on the backend with a RESTful web service to submit the request and dispatch a nearby unicorn. The application will also provide facilities for users to register with the service and log in before requesting rides.

## Tech Stack

The application architecture uses AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, Amazon S3, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Cognito, and AWS Amplify Console. The static web pages use HTML, CSS & JavaScript
